to use pytest simply call the command "pytest" in the directory where you keep your test folder.

pytest search all the directories that contain the name test and will look for all the files with a specific notation:
they need to have in their name "test_" or "_test.py" es: "test_example.py"

the assert command is used to determine wether a statement is true or false, if the statement is true then the test passes else it fails
