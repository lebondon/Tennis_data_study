## Tennis_data_study

This repository is an aggregation of the table tennis dataset for WTA by jack sachman at: https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp and https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_wta .


The tables have been aggregated for years in handy compressed parquet files, with an added ID for each table, you can find them in aggregated_matches_atp and aggregated_tables_wta


I also created a table containing all the tournament contained in the dataset with their respective datas, together with some other utility tables.

## Postgres local Database

I also provided a file on which you can create your local postgres instance and make studies on the tables from there
