this repository is an aggregation of the table tennis dataset for WTA by jack sachman at: https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp and https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_wta .

the tables have been aggregated for years in handy compressed parquet files, with an added ID for each table, you can find them in aggregated_matches_atp and aggregated_tables_wta

## Postgres local Database
